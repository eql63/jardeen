# Jardeen : test automation

This repository houses a collection of automation scripts dedicated to test cases for the evolving application, Jardeen. 

## Demo

![gif_projet_4_demo](https://github.com/eql63/jardeen/assets/150632054/851dee1e-fe87-44fa-8859-179b32d1f48e)



## How to use it

Requirements : 
- Python >= 3.10
- Have followed the procedure for installing and launching the Jardeen application on http://localhost:8080/index.xhtml

### First step:
Clone this repo with Git or download manually the ZIP file.

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/eql63/jardeen.git
```
### Second step: 
Install requirements :
```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Note: use virtual environments such as VENV

### Third Ã©tape : test case execution
Automated test cases use the same names as on Squash. For example, if you want to run the ADP-01 test case present on Squash, you need to enter the following command:
```bash
  python adp-01.py
```

In this POC, only 3 test cases were automated:
- adp-01
- adp-02
- adp-03

## Dataset

Datasets are located in the jdd.py file in dictionary form. Each test case has a list of datasets. Datasets are defined by the variables to be tested and the expected result. For example, a dataset "login_KO" will contain credentials login = "ko", password = "ko" and an "expected" variable = False, as the test is expected to fail with this dataset. 

A "fail_id" dataset has been deliberately included in the list of datasets in test case adp-01 for demonstration purposes. This means that an expected result different from the "expected" variable will be obtained.
